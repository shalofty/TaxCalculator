# taxcalc
# This project is an income tax calculator written in Python

fed_dicts and fed_utils contain tools for calculating federal income tax.
state_dicts and state_utils contain tools for calculating state income tax.

There are three variations in the way states tax citizens:
1) Bracketed taxes
2) Flat rate taxes
3) No taxes

The current working model takes into account the bracketed tax system for the state of Alabama.
Because of the size of the state tax system I haven't finished committing tax data for the other states.
